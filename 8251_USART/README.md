# Communication Circuit Design with 8251

## Problem Statement:
In this lab assignment, the goal is to design a communication circuit using an 8086 Microprocessor and an 8251 USART. The circuit should facilitate communication between the 8086 Microprocessor and a virtual terminal. Students will input a number into the virtual terminal, and their names will be output from the terminal as many times as the number entered.

## Components Used:
- **8086 Microprocessor:** 1 unit
- **74273 Octal D-Type Flip-Flop:** 3 units
- **74154 Demultiplexer:** 1 unit
- **8251 USART (Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter):** 1 unit
- **Virtual Terminal:** 1 unit

## Objectives:
1. Establish communication between the 8086 Microprocessor and the 8251 USART.
2. Configure address assignments for the 8251 USART in the I/O space, starting from address 0300H.
3. Create the necessary connections and addressing circuits between the 8086 and 8251 USART.
4. Implement functionality that allows a student to input a number into the virtual terminal.
5. Output the student's name from the virtual terminal as many times as the number entered.
