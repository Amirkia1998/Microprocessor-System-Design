# ADC/DAC Interface with 8086 Microprocessor

## Problem Statement:
In this lab assignment, you will work with an 8086 microprocessor (¬µI) system to interface with two crucial components: DACA0830 and ADC0804. The goal is to configure these components at specific memory addresses and implement the necessary connections to interact with them. You have three options for this lab, each with its corresponding score.

## Components Used:
- All required components are included in the attached Proteus draft file.
- You can make additions and removals as needed based on your chosen option.

## Options:
### Option A (25 points):
- Generate a triangle wave with a frequency of 50 Hz, ranging from 0 to 5 V, using the DAC (DACA0830).
- Implement a DELAY subroutine to achieve the desired frequency.
- Provide a detailed description of the procedure for generating the triangle wave.

### Option B (50 points):
- Generate a sinusoidal wave with a frequency of 80 Hz using the DAC (DACA0830).
- Implement a DELAY subroutine to achieve the desired frequency.
- The formula for the sinusoidal signal is: ùë£(ùë°) = 2.5 + 2.5 √ó sin(2 √ó ùúã √ó ùëì √ó ùë°).
- Provide a detailed explanation of the procedure for generating the sinusoidal wave.

### Option C (100 points):
- Design an automatic lighting system for a house that adjusts the brightness of a lamp based on ambient light intensity.
- Use an LDR (photo-resistor) connected to the ADC (ADC0804) to measure the brightness.
- Connect a controllable DAC (DACA0830) to the lamp.
- Write an assembly code that reads the light intensity from the LDR and adjusts the lamp brightness accordingly.
- The resistance reading from the LDR is in logarithmic form.
- Provide a comprehensive assembly code for this automatic lighting system.

**Note:** You can choose to complete one, both, or any combination of the options above. Your total score for the lab will be based on the options you complete, with a maximum of 100 points achievable.
